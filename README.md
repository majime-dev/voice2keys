# voice2keys

This is a simple Windows application that maps a given voice command to a sequence of key presses.

The code might not be particularly rustic, since this is is a toy project made while learning Rust.

A sample configuration file used to augment the gameplay in Hogwarts Legacy is included in the repository root, but this can be used to automate pressing a sequence of keys in other applications.

Tested on Windows 10, your mileage may vary.
