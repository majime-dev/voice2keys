This is a simple Windows application that maps a given voice command to a sequence of key presses.

The code might not be particularly rustic, since this is is a toy project made while learning Rust.

A sample configuration file is included in the repository root, comments in the file serve as documentation.

## Known limitations
* No acoustic echo cancellation - use headphones if the audio from your speakers gets picked up as commands.
* This is a toy project, so while it might be as good starting point for your own work, support is not guaranteed.

## Non-goals
* Supporting platforms other than Windows on x86-64.
